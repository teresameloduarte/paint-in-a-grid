# paint-in-a-grid 🎨

paint-in-a-grid is a simple yet creative Java exercise developed during the 5th week of our bootcamp. Using the SimpleGraphics library, this project demonstrates how basic user interactions can bring a graphical grid to life! 

🐢 **what is paint-in-a-grid?**

paint-in-a-grid is a minimalist application where users interact with a grid to "paint" cells using a single color. With just the space key, you can toggle between drawing and erasing, creating pixel-like art. This project focuses on mastering core programming concepts and graphical libraries.

🐢 **features**

- Grid-Based Drawing: Use the space key to fill or erase cells with a single color.
- Dynamic Interaction: Navigate the grid and "paint" by targeting specific cells.
- Minimalistic Approach: Simple functionality with maximum learning potential.


🐢 **tools I used**

- java: Core programming language.
- simpleGraphics library: For creating the grid, handling input, and rendering graphics.
